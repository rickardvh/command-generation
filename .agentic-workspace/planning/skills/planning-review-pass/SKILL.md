# Planning Review Pass

Planning Review Pass is a deliberate analysis skill for future-work discovery.
It exists to capture compact, evidence-backed findings without turning review output into immediate queue churn.

## Operating Rules

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `.agentic-workspace/planning/state.toml`, and any explicitly referenced review scope before starting.
2. Treat the task as analysis, not implementation, unless the prompt explicitly asks for fixes too.
3. Choose one primary review mode from `.agentic-workspace/planning/reviews/README.md` before inspecting deeply.
4. Keep the review bounded to one subsystem, one question, or one risk area. If the user asks for a matrix or portfolio pass, split it into one compact artifact per mode instead of widening one file.
5. Write findings into `.agentic-workspace/planning/reviews/` using the local template.
6. Label each finding with confidence, source class, promotion target, and promotion trigger.
7. Keep friction-confirmed findings distinct from pure analysis findings.
8. Do not add findings directly to `todo.active_items` or create an execplan unless the prompt explicitly asks for promotion.
9. If a bounded review is clean, say so explicitly in the artifact instead of padding it with weak findings.

## Suitable Inputs

Use this skill when the user wants:

- a review pass over one repo area
- analysis of future risks or opportunities
- compact capture of findings for later prioritisation
- a structured artifact rather than chat-only review residue

Do not use it for:

- active implementation work
- broad repo-wide audits with no bounded scope
- static-analysis dump capture without triage
- durable memory capture

Matrix-style or portfolio-wide review requests are allowed only when they stay split into compact per-mode artifacts.

## Execution Loop

1. Define the bounded review question and scope.
2. Choose the primary review mode and inspect the minimum code and docs that mode needs first.
3. Record only evidence-backed findings, or explicitly record that there were no material findings.
4. Classify each finding by source and confidence.
5. Recommend promote, defer, or dismiss outcomes.
6. If the same turn also includes approved fixes, revisit the review output afterward and shrink or delete any spent review residue that no longer needs to stay live.
7. Stop after the review artifact is updated.

## Output Contract

End each run with:

- review scope
- artifact path
- findings captured
- source-class split
- promotion candidates, if any
- explicit note that no activation occurred unless promotion was requested
