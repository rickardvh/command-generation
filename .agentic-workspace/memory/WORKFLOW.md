# Workflow Rules

## Purpose

This file defines the compact shared operating model for memory use.

Keep it concise, repo-agnostic, and non-procedural.

## Operating split

- `AGENTS.md` = local bootstrap contract
- repository planning/status surface = external owner of active execution state
- built-in agent planning = short-horizon planning and execution
- checked-in docs outside `/memory` = canonical repo docs and user-facing engineering guidance
- `/memory` = anti-rediscovery knowledge, not backlog state, active task state, or broad fallback documentation
- planning/status surfaces = shared active/current execution state
- `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/current/routing-feedback.md` = optional routing calibration note for concrete missed-note or over-routing cases
- skills = optional repeatable procedures over checked-in knowledge
- local notes = optional scratch context only

## Interoperability contract

- Memory owns durable repo knowledge: invariants, authority boundaries, recurring failure modes, routing hints, and operator runbooks.
- The repository's active planning/status surface owns active intent and sequencing: current goal, next action, done criteria, milestone status, and backlog state.
- `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/mistakes/recurring-failures.md` is anti-trap memory for repeated or high-likelihood mistakes, not issue tracking or bug triage.
- Memory should not keep shared current task state; use planning/status surfaces for shared continuation and local-only scratch for transient machine-local context.
- Memory complements planning by reducing re-orientation cost and preserving durable lessons; it must never compete with the planning system for ownership of active work.
- Memory is also a pressure layer: if a note exists because the repo is awkward to understand, operate, or change safely, use the note to suggest the code, docs, tooling, test, or refactor change that would let the note shrink, move, or disappear.
- When planning is installed too, memory should help plans stay smaller by holding durable context that execplans can reference instead of repeating.
- Repeated plan re-explanation or restart friction is a missing-synergy signal: either memory routing is too weak, the durable fact belongs in canonical docs, or the work needs better decomposition.

## Core rules

- Keep durable facts, invariants, runbooks, recurring failures, and lightweight shared context in checked-in files.
- Keep repeatable workflow-like actions in skills.
- Use `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/index.md` as the routing layer; do not bulk-load `/memory`.
- Prefer the smallest useful working set.
- Default to `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/index.md` plus at most 2 additional notes unless the task clearly justifies more.
- Treat low-confidence routing as a calibration signal: if routing relies on index or high-level fallbacks instead of direct manifest matches, capture the missed note rather than silently widening the default read set.
- Optimise for deletion and consolidation, not just capture.
- Prefer editing, merging, or removing existing notes over accumulating near-duplicates.
- When referenced behaviour changes, update the note, mark it `Needs verification`, or remove it in the same change.
- Memory is a reasoning aid and hint layer; it does not replace checking code, tests, or canonical docs when they are the source of truth.

## Note maintenance rule

- Update a note when its primary home is still correct and the guidance is still valuable.
- Prune a note when it is obsolete, duplicated, low-value, or easier to recover directly from code or tooling.
- Move closed work into a durable note only when the detail remains hard to recover from code, docs, or tooling.
- When closed work came through planning, promote only the durable residue that future work should not have to rediscover; do not absorb plan history or milestone narration into memory.
- Move procedure-heavy prose into a skill when the durable fact should stay in files but the repeated workflow should become optional execution guidance.
- Prefer one primary home for the durable fact and a short cross-reference elsewhere rather than parallel note copies.
- Ask what repo change would eliminate or shrink the note: canonical docs, stronger tests, validation, a script, a skill, or a clearer design boundary.
- Ask whether the note should still exist at all after that repo change; prefer a stub, short residue note, or deletion over carrying full prose forward by default.

## Closeout-derived residue

- A closeout-derived memory note captures only the compact motivation, constraint, or lesson that future work should not rediscover.
- Do not paste plan history, milestone logs, validation transcripts, backlog state, or archived-plan narration into memory.
- Include why the lesson matters for future work, when to load or use it, its likely canonical owner or promotion target, the promotion trigger, and the intended post-promotion note shape: retain, shrink, stub, or delete.
- Put recurring routing and promotion facts in manifest fields such as `summary`, `applies_to`, `use_when`, `evidence`, `promotion_target`, `promotion_trigger`, and `retention_after_promotion` instead of repeating that boilerplate in prose.
- If the residue already has a stronger home in docs, contracts, checks, code, or planning state, update that home first and leave only a short memory stub when routing value remains.
- If no future work would act differently because of the residue, discard it instead of creating a note.

## Metadata

- Keep strong note metadata so routing and future skills remain reliable.
- Use statuses such as `Stable`, `Active`, `Needs verification`, and `Deprecated`.
- Use ISO dates for `Last confirmed`.
- Prefer `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/manifest.toml` for machine-readable note typing, routing, and freshness triggers when the repository maintains that file.
- Use manifest fields such as `audience`, `canonicality`, `task_relevance`, `routes_from`, and `stale_when` to distinguish note classes, promotion candidates, routing relevance, and freshness pressure.
- Optional manifest fields such as `memory_role`, `symptom_of`, `preferred_remediation`, `improvement_candidate`, `improvement_note`, and `elimination_target` can capture why a note exists and what kind of upstream improvement it may be pointing toward.
- Keep calibration artefacts distinct from durable notes: `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/current/routing-feedback.md` should stay optional, agent-only, and free of broad routing metadata or durable-truth claims.

## Starter templates

- Use `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/templates/memory-note.template.md` for a general durable note or improvement-signal note.
- Use `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/templates/invariant.template.md` when the primary home is a must-remain-true contract.
- Use `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/templates/runbook.template.md` when the primary home is a durable operator procedure.
- Treat the templates as starter shape only; adapt them to the repo and keep the first real note smaller than the template when possible.
- When writing the first repo-specific note for a class, prefer the matching template over copying old example prose forward.

## Improvement metadata quick reference

- `memory_role = "durable_truth"` means the note is expected to stay visible as anti-rediscovery knowledge.
- `memory_role = "improvement_signal"` means the note exists partly because the repo still needs an upstream improvement.
- `preferred_remediation` should name the most likely upstream target: docs, skill, script, test, validation, refactor, or code.
- `improvement_note` should stay short and concrete; say what improvement would reduce the note rather than restating the note.
- `elimination_target` should describe the intended post-remediation shape: shrink, promote, automate, or refactor away.
- `config_treatment` and `config_note` should always be present for `improvement_signal` notes, even when the answer is `no_action`, so config-shaped treatment does not stay implicit.
- `retention_justification` is the fallback when a note remains justified even though it is also an improvement signal.
- Closeout-derived notes should also name `source_closeout`, `promotion_target`, `promotion_trigger`, and `retention_after_promotion` when those are known.
- Use `summary`, `applies_to`, `use_when`, and `evidence` in the manifest for routine note routing; leave note prose for the durable explanation an agent cannot infer from metadata.
- Use the quick reminder in `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/templates/memory-note.template.md` when you are writing the note itself and the fuller workflow below when deciding how to route follow-through.

## Canonical-doc boundary

- Prefer checked-in canonical docs first and memory second when stable policies, procedures, or engineering guidance already have a natural home in `README.md`, `docs/`, or equivalent repo docs.
- Treat memory as assistive residue by default: short lessons, pitfalls, routing hints, operator context, and compact shared state.
- If a memory note becomes stable guidance for humans, mark it as a promotion candidate, move the canonical truth into checked-in docs, then leave a short memory stub or fallback note instead of duplicate prose.
- If a note is already marked `canonical_elsewhere`, keep it visibly smaller than the canonical doc and resist turning fallback context back into a second handbook.
- Do not make core repo docs depend on memory unless the repository explicitly chooses that policy boundary.

## Current-context files

- Shared `project-state.md` and `task-context.md` current-memory files are deprecated migration residue, not normal Memory features.
- New installs should not create shared current-state files.
- Existing `project-state.md` or `task-context.md` files should be migrated: durable facts move into normal memory notes or canonical docs, active state moves into planning/status, and transient context moves into local-only scratch.
- `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/current/routing-feedback.md` is optional routing calibration only.
- Do not treat routing-feedback as durable knowledge; it is temporary calibration input and should be compressed or removed once the route is tuned.
- No shared current-memory file should become a task list, detailed plan, journal, backlog, ledger, tranche history, or duplicated memory summary.
- Keep `routing-feedback.md` compact and review-shaped: record only concrete missed-note or over-routing cases, then compress or remove resolved entries.
- Bias calibration toward missed-note capture first; over-routing cases are useful, but they are more subjective and should stay especially high-signal.
- Treat planner-like headings such as backlog, roadmap, completed tasks, timeline, sprint, action items, or next steps as suspicion signals that the current note may be drifting.

## Ownership boundary

- bootstrap-managed surface in a repo = the workflow pointer block in `AGENTS.md`, `.agentic-workspace/memory/`, and other files the installer classifies as shared replaceable
- repo-owned surface in a repo = customised `AGENTS.md` content outside the workflow pointer block, repo-added sibling skills under `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/skills/`, and ordinary notes outside product-managed shared directories
- `.agentic-workspace/memory/` is product-managed shared guidance and workflow support; treat it as upgrade-replaceable unless the repository is intentionally changing the shared bootstrap contract itself.
- The shipped core skills under `.agentic-workspace/memory/skills/` are also product-managed and may be replaced on upgrade.
- Other checked-in `/memory` notes are repo-owned working knowledge and are expected to diverge from the starter payload over time.
- Runtime-local or user-local mirrored skill copies are cache-only convenience copies, not a durable source of truth.
- When a repo needs local procedure changes, add a new sibling skill under `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/skills/` instead of customising the shipped core skills in place.
- If a local note or skill is meant to survive upgrades unchanged, do not place that repo-specific content in `.agentic-workspace/memory/`.
- Shared guidance about how to use memory skills belongs in product-managed memory files, not in repo-specific `AGENTS.md` prose outside the managed workflow pointer block.

## Skills boundary

- Skills operate on memory; they do not replace it.
- `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/skills/` is reserved for skills whose primary purpose is operating on checked-in memory or maintaining the memory system, not for general repo workflows.
- When a repository has shipped shared memory skills, treat `.agentic-workspace/memory/skills/README.md` as the discovery surface for those skills instead of expanding `AGENTS.md` with more shared trigger prose.
- If prose starts describing a repeatable maintenance, routing, refresh, capture, hygiene, or upgrade workflow, that is usually a skill candidate.
- If a domain or decision note starts accumulating command-heavy repeatable steps, split the procedure into a runbook or checked-in skill before broadening the note further.
- Checked-in repo-local skills should take precedence over runtime-local mirrors or cached user copies when both exist.
- The base memory system must remain understandable without skills.

## Stale-note pressure

- Review notes not only by age, but also when they become large, frequently touched, cross-domain, or hard to route cleanly.
- Pay extra attention to legacy current-memory files such as `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/current/project-state.md` and `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/current/task-context.md`; migrate or delete them instead of normalizing shared active-state storage.
- Freshness review should consider semantic drift as well as age: linked code, commands, authority boundaries, or expected routing surfaces may have changed even when metadata still looks current.
- If a note keeps growing through unrelated edits, split it by primary home or move repeated procedure into a skill.
- Use note-type-aware size pressure: keep invariants especially tight, keep runbooks procedural, and keep optional routing calibration very small.
- Watch for multi-home drift early: procedures do not belong in domain notes, invariants do not belong in runbooks, and durable rationale should not stay buried in operational checklists.

## Capture threshold

- Write to memory only when the fact is hard to recover quickly from code, tests, tooling, or the repository's active planning/status surface.
- If planning keeps reintroducing the same durable explanation, prefer adding or tightening one memory note or canonical doc instead of repeating the prose in each plan.
- Good memory captures include invariants, authority boundaries, recurring failure modes, routing hints, operator runbooks, durable consequences, and still-relevant rejected-path boundaries.
- Do not store milestone status, next-step checklists, backlog state, or execution logs in memory; those belong in the planning/status surface.
- Keep user-specific preferences, collaboration habits, and stylistic defaults out of repo memory unless they are explicitly adopted as shared technical policy.

## Improvement pressure

- Treat durable truth and improvement signals differently.
- Durable truth should remain visible in memory when it is genuinely expensive to rediscover and not better owned elsewhere.
- Improvement signals are notes that exist because the repo still needs clearer docs, better tests, stronger validation, better tooling, cleaner automation, or simpler design.
- Improvement-signal notes should declare either a remediation path or a short retention justification explaining why the note still belongs in memory.
- Do not assume memory volume should trend downward across all repos or stages; some systems genuinely need more durable memory for a time.
- Judge memory by whether it justifies its cost and reduces rediscovery, not by whether the note count falls.
- Do not let improvement-signal notes become permanent substitutes for repo improvements when those improvements are feasible.
- If the same note keeps being needed for safe work on one subsystem, consider whether the repo needs docs promotion, a skill, a script, a regression test, stronger validation, or refactor review.
- Apply that pressure during normal task work, not only during explicit maintenance passes.
- When routing or syncing memory exposes repeated friction, note sprawl, or recurring workarounds, propose or make the smallest upstream improvement that would reduce the note when it is safe and in scope.
- When the same friction shows up again but is still below issue or active-plan threshold, add or update one short dated entry in `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/runbooks/recurring-friction-ledger.md` instead of letting the signal reset into chat.
- When planning and memory are both installed, repeated restart friction or repeated execplan background prose should be treated as an improvement-targeting signal about the interaction contract, not only as a local writing preference.
- Prefer emitting a concrete remediation target over a vague hint: suggest where the docs, skill, script, test, validation, or refactor should land, then keep the memory note only as residue, a stub, or a short fallback summary.
- Treat `promotion-report` as the main elimination workflow: use it to decide the upstream target and the intended post-remediation memory shape before expanding the note further.
- If remediation lands, explicitly re-evaluate whether the note should shrink, become a stub, or disappear instead of assuming it remains justified.
- Keep the package advisory outside managed bootstrap surfaces: it may diagnose, classify, prioritise, and suggest concrete repo-owned targets, but it must not autonomously rewrite repo-owned docs, tests, scripts, or code outside the managed bootstrap surface.
- If remediation suggestions become too repo-shape-specific, prefer a clearer handoff into repo-owned work over making the bootstrap itself more invasive.

## Improvement-targeting workflow

- First decide whether the note is durable truth or a symptom of something that should improve upstream.
- Treat the note as a symptom when it mainly exists because better docs, tests, validation, scripts, skills, refactors, or clearer design boundaries are still missing.
- Choose one primary remediation target category before expanding the note further: canonical docs, regression tests, validation/checks, scripts/commands, skills, refactor/cleanup, or design-boundary clarification.
- Route the signal based on remaining uncertainty:
  - keep it in memory with explicit remediation metadata when the target is obvious and no broader analysis is needed yet
  - create a review artifact when the right upstream target or scope still needs bounded analysis
  - raise or update an issue when the signal should enter the upstream intake layer
  - promote to `roadmap` in `.agentic-workspace/planning/state.toml` when the improvement is plausible future work but not active now
  - promote to `todo.active_items` plus an execplan when the remediation is explicitly selected for active execution
- record the intended post-remediation note shape before closing the signal: retain, shrink, stub, or delete.
- After remediation lands, revisit the note in the same change or the next maintenance pass and either keep it with a short retention justification or shrink, stub, or delete it.
- If the signal keeps surviving several maintenance cycles without a chosen target, treat that as workflow failure and escalate it into review, roadmap, or explicit maintainer triage instead of letting memory remain a silent workaround bucket.

## Remediation paths

- recurring mistakes -> consider regression tests, validation, or lint rules
- prose-heavy procedures -> consider a checked-in skill first, then a repo-owned script or command if the workflow remains mechanical
- stable human-facing guidance -> consider canonical docs, with memory left as a stub or backlink
- large orientation notes for one code area -> consider refactor review or clearer boundaries
- repeated routing crutches for one awkward area -> consider naming, structure, or ownership cleanup

## Anti-patterns

- turning memory into a task tracker
- copying plan content into durable notes
- storing rediscoverable facts that are easier to inspect directly
- coupling freshness checks to a specific planner or planning file
- forcing repositories to adopt the memory taxonomy inside their planning system

## Local notes

- Local scratch is optional only.
- It must not become required shared knowledge or hidden task state.

## Before ending a task

1. Update or remove stale memory in the same change.
2. Keep active shared state in planning/status and transient handoff context in local-only scratch.
3. Update `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/current/routing-feedback.md` only for concrete routing calibration.
4. If repeated friction appeared during the work, capture or update the smallest dated entry in `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/runbooks/recurring-friction-ledger.md` before ending the task.
