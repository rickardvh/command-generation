# <Title>

## Status

Stable | Active | Needs verification | Deprecated

Use one status exactly as written above.

## Canonicality

agent_only | candidate_for_promotion | canonical_elsewhere | deprecated

Use `agent_only` for compact assistive memory.
Use `candidate_for_promotion` when the note is stabilising into normal repo docs.
Use `canonical_elsewhere` when checked-in docs already own the truth and this note is only residue, routing help, or a stub.
Keep the note short when it is `agent_only`: prefer lessons, pitfalls, and residue over full handbook prose.

## Structured manifest metadata

Prefer `.agentic-workspace/memory/repo/manifest.toml` for recurring routing and promotion facts:

- `summary`: compact note summary
- `applies_to`: paths, subsystems, commands, or surfaces this note covers
- `use_when`: when an agent should load or apply this note
- `stale_when`: files or surfaces that should trigger review
- `evidence`: source files, checks, commits, or docs that ground this note
- `promotion_target`: stronger canonical owner, if known
- `promotion_trigger`: signal that should move this note to the stronger owner
- `retention_after_promotion`: retain | shrink | stub | delete

Keep prose below for durable explanation only.

## Improvement signal metadata

Required when the note exists because of repo friction rather than durable truth:

- `memory_role`: `durable_truth` or `improvement_signal`
- `preferred_remediation`: `docs` | `skill` | `script` | `test` | `validation` | `refactor` | `code`
- `elimination_target`: `shrink` | `promote` | `automate` | `refactor_away`
- `config_treatment`: `promote` | `cleanup` | `retain` | `no_action`
- `config_note`: short note describing which current config rule or posture shaped that treatment

Use these when you want the package to recommend an upstream improvement that should reduce the note later.
Prefer a concrete remediation target and an explicit post-remediation memory shape over vague prose.
If the likely post-remediation shape is "delete this note", say so explicitly instead of assuming the note will continue by default.
Use `config_treatment = "no_action"` with a short `config_note` when current config does not materially change treatment but you still need that non-effect to be explicit.

## Closeout-derived residue

Use this section only when the note is created from completed work or planning closeout:

- `source_closeout`: issue, plan, PR, commit, or other closeout surface
- `motivation`: compact motivation, constraint, or lesson worth preserving
- `why_it_matters`: why future work should act differently because this exists
- `use_when`: when an agent should load or apply this residue
- `promotion_target`: likely canonical owner, such as docs, contracts, checks, code, or planning
- `promotion_trigger`: concrete signal that should move the truth to the stronger home
- `retention_after_promotion`: retain | shrink | stub | delete

Do not paste plan history, milestone logs, validation transcripts, backlog state, or archived-plan narration here.
If the residue is already canonical elsewhere, update that owner first and keep this note as a compact routing stub only when it still saves rediscovery.

## Scope

<files / subsystem / surface>

## Applies to

List concrete files, modules, tools, commands, or runtime surfaces that this note relates to.

Use concrete paths, modules, tools, commands, or runtime surfaces so agents can match touched files to relevant notes quickly.

This helps agents determine relevance from touched files during a task.

Examples:
- src/<subsystem>/*
- <interface entrypoint path>
- <runtime surface or command>

## Load when

- <When an agent should read this note>

## Review when

- <What changes should trigger re-checking this note>

## Failure signals

- <Signals indicating this note may apply>

## Rule or lesson

- <Core rule or durable lesson>
- Prefer durable orientation or boundary knowledge here; move procedure-heavy repeated steps into a skill or runbook as appropriate.
- If the note starts mixing boundaries, invariants, rationale, and repeatable steps, split those into separate primary homes instead of keeping a multi-home note.
- If the note starts to read like a reusable maintenance script or refresh checklist, prefer a skill instead.
- If the content becomes stable human-facing policy or procedure, promote it into checked-in canonical docs and reduce this note to a short stub or fallback summary.

Examples

- Good compact memory: "Rollback usually fails when release verification races cache invalidation; verify service health before retrying."
- Likely canonical doc instead: "Full deployment procedure for production, staging, and rollback."

## How to recognise it

## Verify

- <Files, tests, commands, or checks that confirm this note is still correct>

## Verified against

- Optional: list the exact files, interfaces, commands, or test suites this note was last checked against.

## Last confirmed
