# Workspace Startup / Operating Loop

Use this skill for ordinary AW startup, resume, changed-path implementation, proof approach, closeout, or routed fallback in an installed Agentic Workspace repo.
When Agentic Workspace is enabled, this is the canonical main operating skill. Advisory skill routing and `implementation_allowed` never bypass startup, Planning gates, proof, or closeout.

Do not use this as a broad manual. Load specialized AW subskills only when the compact router, task shape, or this skill names their narrower job.

## Configured Invocation

Use the configured AW invocation exposed by the repo adapter, config, or compact startup/config output. In an installed repo this may look like `agentic-workspace ...`; in a source checkout or dev-dependency install it may be a repo-local command. Do not prefer a bare selector when adapter/config names a different invocation.

## Procedure

1. Run the configured invocation with `start --target . --task "<task>" --format json` for ordinary first contact.
2. If changed paths are already known, run the configured invocation with `implement --target . --changed <paths> --task "<task>" --format json`.
3. Preserve `module_slot`, `next_safe_action`, `allowed_actions`, `forbidden_actions`, `proof_required`, and `completion_claim_allowed`.
4. Follow `next_safe_action` before opening raw `.agentic-workspace/` files or running drill-down commands.
5. Keep direct work direct when the router allows no-artifact work; do not create Planning, Memory, review, or handoff artifacts just to show work.
6. Load specialized subskills only for routed intent/shape, proof, setup, or fallback/reference needs.
7. Before claiming completion, reconcile intent, proof, residue, issue/PR closure, and next owner separately.

## Subskill Routes

- `workspace-intent-discovery`: ambiguous human intent, vague outcome prompts, or direct/bounded/lane/epic work-shape decisions.
- `workspace-proof-selection`: proof selection or interpretation for task, slice, lane, epic, skipped, warning, retry, crash, or negative evidence.
- `workspace-setup-jumpstart`: newly installed or adopted AW in a lived-in repo that needs bounded post-bootstrap seeding.
- `workspace-operating-loop` / `workspace-transition-gates`: reference support only when `module_slot`, `forbidden_actions`, preferred invocation fallback, or transition gate details need interpretation.

## Red Flags

Red flag:
  I can inspect raw planning or memory files first because the request seems simple.

Use instead:
  Run the configured invocation with `start --target . --task "<task>" --format json`, or the known dedicated AW command when the request already names one, then follow `next_safe_action`.

## SkillSpec Pilot

This skill is the hand-authored startup pilot for the `startup-router` SkillSpec contract in `src/agentic_workspace/contracts/skill_specs.json`.

- Preferred route: configured AW invocation with `start --target . --task "<task>" --format json`.
- Interpreted fields: `workflow_participation`, `immediate_next_allowed_action`, `next_safe_action`, `planning_safety_gate`, `skill_routing.preferred_routes`, and `detail_commands`.
- Direct work: if compact startup does not require planning and proof is obvious, keep the work direct and avoid planning, review, Memory, or handoff artifacts.
- Planning work: if `planning_safety_gate.implementation_allowed` is false, run the named planning command before implementation.
- No-CLI fallback: read `.agentic-workspace/WORKFLOW.md` only far enough to preserve the same forbidden actions and no-artifact-by-default rule.

## Module Map

- Workspace orchestrates startup, lifecycle, config, ownership, proof routing, reports, and module composition.
- Planning owns active execution state, checked-in execplans, decomposition records, proof expectations, and closeout routing.
- Memory owns durable anti-rediscovery knowledge: invariants, boundaries, runbooks, routing hints, and recurring failure lessons.
- Generated references own exact field names and structured output shapes after conceptual docs explain the behavior.

Use `.agentic-workspace/docs/module-map.md` when a short installed-repo module map is enough and broader package docs would cost too much context.

## Closeout

For planned work, closeout is not only validation success. Separate proof, intent satisfaction, issue completion, durable residue, and dogfooding findings. Route future-relevant learning to Memory, docs, checks, contracts, config, Planning, or an issue. Do not keep completed execplans as the ordinary knowledge base.
