# Workspace Work Shape Reference

Do not use this as an independently invoked subskill. `workspace-intent-discovery` owns the merged intent/shape procedure after the main AW operating skill routes there.
When AW is enabled, this reference preserves the same routed workflow boundary as the main skill; it does not make work-shape judgment a bypass around startup, planning or proof gates.

This reference exists so compact output, reviews, or issue discussions can name the work-shape vocabulary without reloading the full intent protocol.

## Vocabulary

- `direct`: target and proof are obvious; answer or edit with the narrowest proof and no durable artifact unless routed.
- `bounded`: finite implementation with meaningful proof, continuation, or issue-linkage risk; use compact implement/proof routing.
- `lane`: multi-slice or issue-lane work; checked-in Planning state owns sequencing before implementation.
- `epic`: multiple lanes, high assurance, or unclear decomposition; shape before implementation.

## External Reporting Targets

Use this as an agent checklist, not as runtime keyword policy. Issue or PR references used only as comment, report, reply, evidence-hub, or follow-up destinations are context for the current communication task. Do not treat those refs as implementation issue scope or multi-issue lane evidence by themselves.

When a task mixes an implementation issue with a reporting target, separate them before judging shape:

- implementation refs may carry issue scope and proof obligations;
- reporting target refs identify where to post, edit, or read a comment;
- the agent still owns the final direct/bounded/lane judgment from action safety, source impact, proof burden, and closure claims.

Do not implement this distinction with hardcoded prompt/prose keyword matching in AW runtime. Runtime may expose neutral refs, structured PR refs, changed paths, active Planning state, and proof facts; the semantic split belongs to this checklist and agent judgment.

## Reference Output

When this reference is explicitly requested, report the inferred intended outcome, work shape, why that shape fits, the first repo-visible surface to inspect or update, satisfaction evidence, required next route, and whether Planning state is optional, recommended, or required.
