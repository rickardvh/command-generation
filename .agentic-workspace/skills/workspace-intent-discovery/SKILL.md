# Workspace Intent Discovery

Use this skill when a prompt is broad, vague, high-stakes, or outcome-shaped enough that silently choosing a first implementation slice could miss the user's real goal.

## Protocol

1. Name two or three plausible interpretations, not just one inferred intent.
2. Ask one compact question that captures why the work matters, desired outcome, non-goals, and an acceptable first slice.
3. If the user does not answer and progress is still safe, proceed only with stated assumptions and visible uncertainty.
4. Carry the clarified result into the smallest existing surface: `task_intent`, `acceptance`, `durable_intent`, Memory, Planning, or an issue.
5. Stop the dialogue after one bounded clarification unless the user's answer exposes a real safety, authority, or scope blocker.

## Output Shape

- `inferred_intent`
- `uncertainty`
- `candidate_interpretations`
- `likely_non_goals`
- `stakes_if_wrong`
- `proposed_first_slice`
- `question_to_user`
- `proceed_without_answer_when`
- `captured_intent_after_reply`
- `promotion_target`

## Examples

Ask:
  "Make onboarding better." The outcome, audience, non-goals, and first slice are unclear enough that implementation or Planning would guess.

Acknowledge and proceed:
  "Implement #1234." The issue can carry detail; state the interpretation, first slice, and correction point before editing.

Do not interrupt:
  "Fix the typo in README.md." The target and proof are direct; clarification would add cost without preserving intent.
